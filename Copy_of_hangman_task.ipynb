We recommend installing all the data for NLTK, since you will need various parts of it to complete this assignment. You can also use any Python built-in packages, but do not use any other 3rd party packages (the packages listed above are all fine to use); if your iPython notebook doesn't run on the marker's machine, you will lose marks. <b> You should use Python 3.8</b>; libraries/packages should be in their latest version that is compatible with python3.8.  \n",

Different lengths tend to have different distributions over characters, e.g., short words are less likely to have suffixes or prefixes. You should incorporate this idea by conditioning the unigram model on the length of the secret word, i.e.,  having a **different unigram model for each length**. You will need to be a little careful at test time, to be robust to the situation that you encounter a word length that you didn't see in training. In such a case, your method should behave like the previous `unigram_guesser` in Question 3 (i.e., it guesses characters based on unigram frequencies, unconditioned by the word length).\n",

The order of characters is obviously important, yet this wasn't incorporated in any of the above models. Knowing that the word has the sequence `n _ s s` is a pretty strong clue that the missing character might be `e`.

In the case for the last blank, you should revert to using a unigram language model (since there's no context for us to use the bigram model).
